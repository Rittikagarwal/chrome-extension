# chrome-extension
A chrome extension to help in proctoring of students by restricting some of their activities.
Download the code.
In the background.js file , change the link (example.com/test-link) to something the test link will surely contain.
Sava the file then open chrome.
Go to extention and click on load unpacked.
From there select the chrome-extention folder.
Currently working fine for manifest-version 2, so we can ignore the warning.
Now the extention is good to go. Click on the extention icon to activate it from the puzzle like shape just beside the bookmark icon.
